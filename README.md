# capstone_project: Crypto Dashboard

## Purpose
To build a one stop platform for crypto investors to review historical to current trends for different crypto currencies. The users will also be able to conduct correlation between different currencies and make investment decisions.

## Tools used
Python and Streamlit

## Definitions
1. Bollinger Band: A Bollinger Band® is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a  simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price, but which can be adjusted to user preferences.
2. Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD): Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, which is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100.
4. Exponential Moving Average (EMA): An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average.
