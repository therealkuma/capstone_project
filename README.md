# Capstone_Project: Crypto Wallet Dashboard

## Purpose
To build a one stop platform for crypto investors to review historical to current trends for different crypto currencies. The users will also be able to conduct correlation between different currencies and make investment decisions. The investor will then be able to use the wallet to send transactions to buy and sell cryptos.

## Tools used
Python, Streamlit, Web3 and Ganache

## Definitions
1. Bollinger Band: A Bollinger Band® is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a  simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price, but which can be adjusted to user preferences.
2. Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD): Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, which is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100.
4. Exponential Moving Average (EMA): An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average.

## Dashboard walkthrough

Step 1: The user can select any crypto from the drop down for reviewing the historical trends

Step 2: The user can select a date range using a calender and can define a start date and end date for their analysis

Step 3: Use various technical analysis as defined above

Eg. xxxxxx

Step 4: User can also dowload the data for any offline analysis

## Utlizing the wallet

After the review of historical trends, the investor can transact using the wallet, created using Web3 and Ganache. In the current version, the investor can only make buy and sell transaction using the wallet, but this can be extended to an exchange where other investors can add their accounts to send and recieve the crypto assets.
